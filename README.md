# Abstract
Music composition is one of the most artistic fields demonstrating human creativity. Currently a music composer is an occupation for human being. It is a highly specified field that it takes years to cultivate a music composer. The development of techniques in artificial intelligence provides human a computational perspective to approach this centuried problem. However, the performance of computer composition system is far from
satisfactory.

### Music Theory Cannot be Applied Directly
Although principals are available from music theory, they are subjective guidelines for musiciansâ€™ reference, i.e., they cannot be applied directly to computer as hard rules. Furthermore, there can be implicitly rules that have not discovered by human being. For both music composition and evaluation, existing studies still rely on human beings. Both music composition and evaluation using computational method is still under research.
### Computational Approach has Excessive Search Space
The search space is tremendous to handle in view of the computation ability of current personal computers. For a piece of music lasting for 1 minute with the notes restricted to C major scale, the search space for a totally random music can easily be 7 to the power of around one hundred.

This project attempts at generating a relatively short melody using techniques from machine learning. The aim of this project is to build a simple melody generation system, and analyze generated music in a quantitative manner. This report will firstly examines techniques in literature, and then describe the methodology of conduting the whole music generation process. Finally, results will be shown with discussions and future improvement will be suggested.






# OBJECTIVE

  The objective of this project is to build a music composition system using machine learning algorithms. The scale of this system should be small in a sense that it generates a piece of short melody. The generated music can not only be used for further evaluation, but also serve as an input to a larger scale music generator to compose longer music. The generated music demonstrates explicit patterns similar to the inputted human composed music. The equipment needed for this system is a normal computer.

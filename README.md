# OBJECTIVE

  The objective of this project is to build a music composition system using machine learning algorithms. The scale of this system should be small in a sense that it generates a piece of short melody. The generated music can not only be used for further evaluation, but also serve as an input to a larger scale music generator to compose longer music. The generated music demonstrates explicit patterns similar to the inputted human composed music. The equipment needed for this system is a normal computer.
